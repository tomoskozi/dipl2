URL - i.e., an URL that begins with
<em>rtsp://</em>
<p>

<a name="basic"></a>
<h2>Basic operation</h2>

The simplest way to run this program is:
<pre>
        openRTSP <em>&lt;url&gt;</em>
</pre>
where <em>&lt;url&gt;</em> is a RTSP URL to open
(i.e., beginning with "rtsp://").
The program will open the given URL (using RTSP's "DESCRIBE" command),
retrieve the session's SDP description,
and then, for each audio/video subsession whose RTP payload format it
understands, "SETUP" and "PLAY" the subsession.
<p>
The received data for each subsession is written into a separate output
file, named according to its MIME type.
For example, if the session contains a MPEG-1 or 2 audio subsession
(RTP payload type 14) - e.g., MP3 - and a MPEG-1 or 2 video
subsession (RTP payload type 32),
then each subsession's data
will be extracted from the incoming RTP packets and
written to files named "audio-MPA-1" and "video-MPV-2" (respectively).
(You will probably then need to rename these files
- by giving them an appropriate filename extension
(e.g., ".mp3" and ".mpg") - in order
to be able to play them using common media player tools.)
<p>
You can use the
"<strong>-F <em>&lt;fileName-prefix&gt;</em></strong>" option to
add a prefix to the file name that is written for each subsession.
(This can be useful if you are running "openRTSP" several times,
in the same directory,
to read data from different RTSP sessions.)
<p>

<h3>Extracting a single stream (to 'stdout')</h3>

To record only the audio stream from a session, use the
"<strong>-a</strong>" command-line option.
(Similarly, to record only the video stream, use the
"<strong>-v</strong>" option.)
In this case, the output audio (or video) stream will
be written to 'stdout', rather than to a file.

<h3>More verbose diagnostic output</h3>
For more verbose diagnostic output, use the
"<strong>-V</strong>" (upper-case) option.
With this option, the program will print out each complete
RTSP request and response.
This can be useful for figuring out exactly why a "SETUP"
or "PLAY" operation failed.

<p><hr><p>

<a name="no-receive"></a>
<h2>Playing without receiving</h2>

If you want the program to <em>play</em> the RTSP session,
but not actually <em>receive</em> it, you can do so by giving the
program the
"<strong>-r</strong>" ('don't receive') option.
This is useful if you have a separate application (running on the same
host) that actually receives the incoming media session(s).
(Note that this separate receiving application should also send back
RTCP Reception Reports, to ensure that the session doesn't time out.)
<p>
If you use the "-r" option to play a unicast session,
you'll probably also want to use the
"<strong>-p <em>&lt;startingPortNumber&gt;</em></strong>" option.
This option tells the program which client port numbers to use in the
RTSP "SETUP" commands - i.e., which RTP/RTCP
ports the server should send to.
(Without the "-r" option, the program receives the streams itself,
and uses its own ephemeral port numbers for this.)
<em>&lt;startingPortNumber&gt;</em> must be an even number.
<p>
For example, if the RTSP session consists of an audio and a video
subsession (listed in that order in the returned SDP description), then
"-p 6666" will cause ports 6666 and 6667 to be used for the
audio subsession (6666 for RTP; 6667 for RTCP),
and ports 6668 and 6669 to be used for
the video subsession (6668 for RTP; 6669 for RTCP).
<p>
(If you use the "-r" option to play a <em>multicast</em> session,
then you probably won't also need to use the
"-p <em>&lt;startingPortNumber&gt;</em>" option, because the SDP
description for multicast sessions usually includes a port number to use.)

<p><hr><p>

<a name="playing-time"></a>
<h2>Playing-time options</h2>

If the SDP description (from the RTSP server) contains a
"a=range:npt= ..." attribute specifying an end time, then the program
will close down the session and exit shortly after
(by default, 5 seconds after) this time elapses.
<p>
You can change this end time using the
"<strong>-e <em>&lt;endTime&gt;</em></strong>" option.
If
<em>&lt;endTime&gt;</em>
is positive, it is the total number of
seconds to delay before closing down the session and exiting.  If
<em>&lt;endTime&gt;</em>
is negative, then
-<em>&lt;endTime&gt;</em>
gives the number of extra seconds to delay after the time specified
in the SDP "a=range" attribute.
(As noted above, the default value for this extra time is 5 seconds.)
<p>
For example, if the SDP description contains
"a=range:npt=0-25", then
"-e 10"
means "play the stream(s) for 10 seconds, then exit", and
"-e -10"
means "play the stream(s) for 35 seconds, then exit".
<p>
You can also use the
"<strong>-E <em>&lt;maximum-inter-packet-gap&gt;</em></strong>" option
to ask that the program shut down if no new incoming RTP (i.e., data)
packets are received within a period of at least
<em>&lt;maximum-inter-packet-gap&gt;</em>
seconds.
This option is useful if you are running the program automatically
(e.g., from within a script), and wish to allow for the possibility
of servers that die
unexpectedly.
(Note that "-e" and "-E" are different options, and may both be used.)
<p>
Note, however, that if
the program receives a RTCP "BYE" packet from the source - for every stream
in the session - then the program will close down the session and
exit immediately, regardless of the use of the "-e" and/or "-E" options.
<p>
You can also use the
"<strong>-c</strong>"
option to play the media
sessions continuously.
I.e., after the end time has elapsed, the program starts all over again,
by issuing another set of "PLAY" requests.
(Note that if you're receiving data (i.e., you don't use the "-r" option),
then this means you'll get multiple copies of the data in
the output file(s).)
<p>
Note that you can combine "-c" with
"-e <em>&lt;endTime&gt;</em>"
and/or
"-E <em>&lt;maximum-inter-packet-gap&gt;</em>".
So, for example,
"-c -e 10"
means "play the stream(s) for 10 seconds, then go back and play
them again for another 10 seconds, etc., etc."

<p><hr><p>

<a name="access-control"></a>
<h2>Streaming access-controlled sessions</h2>

Some RTSP servers require user authentication (via a name and password)
before a session can be streamed.  To stream such a session, use the
"<strong>-u <em>&lt;username&gt;</em> <em>&lt;password&gt;</em></strong>" option.
(To specify an empty password, use
<em>""</em> for <em>&lt;password&gt;</em>.)
The program authenticates using RTSP "digest authentication"; the password
will <em>not</em> get sent in the clear over the net.
<p>
Alternatively, you could try including the user name and password inside
the URL, as:
"rtsp://<em>&lt;username&gt;</em>:<em>&lt;password&gt;</em>@<em>&lt;hostname&gt;</em>:<em>&lt;etc.&gt;</em>".
(In this case, though, the password <em>will</em> be sent in the clear
over the net.  Also, not all servers will accept this type of URL.)

<p><hr><p>

<a name="quicktime"></a>
<h2>Outputting a ".mov", ".mp4", or ".avi"-format file</h2>

Use the
"<strong>-q</strong>"
option to output the received data to 'stdout' in the form of an
Apple
<a HREF="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuickTime/QuickTime.html">QuickTime '.mov'-format file</a>.
Each received subsession will be have its own track in the output file.
<p>
Similarly, the
"<strong>-4</strong>"
option produces a '.mp4'-format (i.e., MPEG-4) file.
<p>
At present these options are fully supported for only a limited number of codecs.
For those codecs that are not fully supported, the program will
still store all of its received data into a movie track, but will
use a dummy Media Data Atom (named '????') in the Sample Description.
(This track will also be disabled.)
Before you can play such a track, you will need to
edit the file.
<p>
If the session contains a video subsession, you should also use the
"<strong>-w <em>&lt;width&gt;</em></strong>",
"<strong>-h <em>&lt;height&gt;</em></strong>"
and
"<strong>-f <em>&lt;frame-rate&gt;</em></strong>"
options
to specify the width and height (in pixels), and frame rate
(per-second) of the corresponding
video track.
(If these options are omitted, then the values width=240 pixels;
height=180 pixels; frame-rate=15 are used.)
<p>
<small>
Alternatively, if the session's SDP description contains the
media-level attribute
"a=x-dimensions: <em>&lt;width&gt;</em>,<em>&lt;height&gt;</em>",
then these values will be used instead (in which case you won't need
to use the "-w" and "-h" options).
Similarly, if the session's SDP description contains the
media-level attribute
"a=x-framerate: <em>&lt;frames-per-second&gt;</em>",
then this value will be used instead (in which case you won't need
to use the "-f" option).
</small>
<p>
If the resulting QuickTime movie file contains audio and video tracks that
are out-of-sync, then you can use the 
"<strong>-y</strong>"
option to try to generate synchronized audio/video tracks.
(This option works by listening for RTCP "Sender Report" packets
- containing time synchronization information - for each stream.
Some initial, unsynchronized data may end up being discarded.)
<p>
The
"<strong>-H</strong>"
option will also generate a QuickTime 'hint track' for each audio or video
track.
This is useful if you later wish to stream the resulting ".mov" or ".mp4" file.
<p>
<small>
<em>Note:</em>
"openRTSP"s support for creating QuickTime format files is
rather limited.
At present, only PCM (u-law and a-law),
MPEG-4, GSM
and QCELP (aka. 'PureVoice') audio is supported,
and only MPEG-4 and H.263/H.263+ video is supported.
(Also, for creating <em>hinted</em>
QuickTime format files, QCELP audio is not currently supported.)
</small>

<p>
The
"<strong>-i</strong>"
option produces a '.avi'-format file.
(This functionality is not fully-supported.
MPEG-1, 2 or 4, JPEG and H.263 video is supported,
along with raw PCM or u-law audio.
However, MPEG and other audio codecs are not yet supported.)
<p><hr><p>

<a name="other-options"></a>
<h2>Other options</h2>

<h3>Notification of data arrival</h3>
Use the
"<strong>-n</strong>"
option
if you wish to be 'notified'
(with a console message)
when the first data (RTP) packets begin
arriving.
<p>

<h3>Receiving streamed data via TCP instead of UDP</h3>
If you're not receiving any data packets
(you can test this using "-n"), then you may be behind a firewall
that (stupidly) blocks UDP packets.
If this is the case, you can use the
"<strong>-t</strong>"
option
to request that the RTSP server stream RTP and RTCP data packets over
its TCP connection, instead of using UDP packets.
(Note that not all RTSP servers support TCP streaming, and that
TCP cannot be used to receive multicast streams.)
<p>
You should use this option only if you are unable to receive UDP packets,
or if you are recording the stream for later playback, and need to do so
without packet loss.
Streaming over TCP can cause incoming data to be excessively delayed,
which is inappropriate if the data is being processed in real time.
<p>
Alternatively, you can use the
"<strong>-T <em>&lt;http-port-number&gt;</em></strong>"
option to request that the stream be sent (using TCP) over a
"<a HREF="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuickTime/QTSS/Concepts/chapter_2_section_14.html">RTSP-over-HTTP tunnel</a>", using the specified HTTP port number.
RTSP-over-HTTP tunneling can be useful if you are behind a HTTP-only firewall.
(Note, however, that not all RTSP servers support this.)

<p>

<h3>Receiving unsupported RTP payload formats</h3>

Note: An "RTP payload format" for a codec is a set of rules that define how
the codec's media frames are packed within RTP packets.
This is usually defined by an IETF RFC
(or, for newer payload formats, an IETF Internet-Draft).
<p>
By default, the program will ignore any subsession whose RTP payload format
it doesn't understand (because, if it doesn't know the RTP payload format,
it doesn't know how to extract data from the incoming RTP stream).
<p>
However, if an input stream uses a RTP payload format
that the program does not support, then you <em>may</em> still
be able to
receive this data, by using
the
"<strong>-s <em>&lt;byte-offset&gt;</em></strong>"
option.
This option tells the program to assume that any such unsupported stream
uses a very 'simple' RTP payload format, in which the stream's data
is packed contiguously into RTP packets, following the RTP header.
(In particular, the payload format must not use interleaving.)
<em>&lt;byte-offset&gt;</em> specifies the size (in bytes) of
any special header that follows the standard RTP header.
(This special header is skipped over, and is not interpreted at all.)
<p>
For example, if the program didn't already handle PCM u-law audio
("audio/PCMU"; RTP payload format code 0), then you could receive it using
the option
"-s 0".
If the program didn't already handle MPEG audio
("audio/MPEG"; RTP payload format code 14), then you could receive it
using the option
"-s 4"
(because the RTP payload format for MPEG audio, defined in RFC 2250,
specifies a (basically useless) 4-byte header at the start of the RTP payload).

<h3>Outputting QOS statistics</h3>
Use the "<strong>-Q</strong>" option to output QOS
("quality of service") statistics about the data stream
(when the program exits).
These statistics include the (minimum, average, maximum)
bitrate, packet loss rate, and inter-packet gap.
<p>
The "-Q" option takes an optional
<em>&lt;measurement-interval&gt;</em>
parameter, which specifies the length of the
time intervals - in multiples
of 100ms - over which the "minimum, average, maximum"
statistics are computed.
The default value of this parameter is "10", meaning
that these statistics are measured every 1 second
(i.e., 10x100ms). 

<h3>Outputting server options</h3>

By default, the program sends an "OPTIONS" command before sending 
"DESCRIBE".
The purpose of the "OPTIONS" command is ask the server to respond with the
list of commands that it supports.
<p>
If the "<strong>-o</strong>" option is given, then the program sends the
"OPTIONS" command <em>only</em>.
If the "-o" option is given, then all other command-line options
- except "-V" (verbose output) - are ignored.
<p>
The "<strong>-O</strong>" option has the opposite effect: It tells the
program to <em>not</em> send an "OPTIONS" command prior to sending
"DESCRIBE".


<h3>Outputting each frame into a separate file</h3>
If the "<strong>-m</strong>" option is given, each incoming 'frame'
will be written into a separate output file.
(Note that 'frame' in this case is a discrete unit of data that comes
from a 'RTPSource'.  For some RTP payload formats (such as motion-JPEG),
each file will contain a complete image.
For other RTP payload formats (such as MPEG video), each file will 
contain a smaller unit of data, such as a video header structure,
or a frame 'slice'.)
To distinguish the output files, each 'frame's presentation time is used
in the suffix of the corresponding output file.

<h3>Changing the output file buffer size</h3>
If you see an error message
<em>"The total received frame size exceeds the client's buffer size"</em>,
then this indicates that incoming RTP data formed a frame that
was too large for this program's output file buffer.
By default, a 20 kByte buffer is used, so this situation usually does not
occur.
(It occurs only for codecs - such as JPEG - that can have very large frames.)
<p>
If, however,
you see this error message, you can increase the output file buffer size
using the "<strong>-b <em>&lt;buffer-size&gt;</em></strong>" option.

<h3>Changing the input network socket buffer size</h3>
You can also use the
"<strong>-B <em>&lt;buffer-size&gt;</em></strong>" option
to change the size of the input buffer that the underlying
operating system uses for network sockets.
(You probably won't need to use this option, because the operating system's
default buffer size is usually sufficient.)

<h2>A note about RealAudio and RealVideo sessions</h2>

Note that this program <em>cannot</em> be used to receive RealAudio and/or
RealVideo sessions - even those described by a "rtsp://" URL - because
these sessions do not use RTP for transport.
(Instead, these sessions use RealNetworks' proprietary
"RDT" protocol.)

<p><hr><p>

<a name="source-code"></a>
<h2>Source code</h2>

This program uses the "RTSPClient", "MediaSession",
"FileSink", "QuickTimeFileSink",
and several "*RTPSource" modules from the "liveMedia" library,
which is distributed as part of the
"<a HREF="../liveMedia/">LIVE555 Streaming Media</a>"
source code package.
(Other RTSP clients could readily be built from this code.)
<p>
The source code for the program itself is also bundled with this package,
as the files "openRTSP.cpp"
and "playCommon.cpp",
in the "testProgs" directory.
See the
<a HREF="../liveMedia/">"LIVE555 Streaming Media"
documentation</a>
for instructions on how to build this program from source.
<p>

<em>Note:</em>
If you are looking for an example of how to use the
"LIVE555 Streaming Media" code to build your own RTSP/RTP media player client,
then the "openRTSP" source code is not the best example to use, because
it includes lots of extra 'bells and whistles'.
Instead, you should look at the
RTSP/RTP client support in the
"<a HREF="http://www.live555.com/mplayer/">MPlayer</a>"
media player.
(Note, in particular, the files "demux_rtp*" in the
"libmpdemux" directory.)
