liblivemedia (2010.04.09-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Note that the license of this package has changed from LGPL to GPL. This
  change is effective since liblivemedia 2008.07.25-1.

  If you need to build and distribute non-GPL'd application with liblivemedia
  you need to recompile this package without
  debian/patches/022_safe_setlocale.diff. But you will loose thread safety.
