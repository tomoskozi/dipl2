* There is an helper target in debian/rules to update debian/upstream.changelog

* This package uses quilt to manage all modifications to the upstream
source.  Changes are stored in the source package as diffs in
debian/patches and applied during the build.

See /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source for details how to use quilt.
